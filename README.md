# D3-Challenge

D3 Challenge, You need to create a scatter plot between multiple set of the data variables such as Healthcare vs. Poverty or Smokers vs. Age.

For the X-Axis, I chose these data points:

* In Poverty (%)
* Age (Median)
* Household Income (Median)

For the Y-Axis, I chose these data points:

* Lacks Health Care (%)
* Smokes (%)
* Obese (%)

The plot also calculates the Linear Regression Line and provides the equation for it in the form of: y = mx + b.

Furthermore, the commentary changes based upon the selections made.
